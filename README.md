# 4_Strings

#1)

This code prompts the user to enter a mathematical operator and two numbers, performs the corresponding operation, and then asks the user if they want to continue. If the user enters "Yes", the program will repeat the process, otherwise it will end.

#2)

This code checks if a given string is a valid identifier in Python. It does this by checking if the string matches any of the Python keywords, contains any punctuation marks, begins with a digit or starts with a capital letter. If the string passes all of these tests, it is considered a valid identifier and the program prints "True". Otherwise, it prints "False".
